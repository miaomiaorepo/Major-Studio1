### Plan A: Keywords in SDG reports

Keep working on the qualitative project - word frequency in SDG reports. First, go back to data cleaning to improve the word tokenizer according to UN phrases, for example, loading “sub-Saharan Africa” instead of “sub-Saharan” and “Africa”. Second, add scrollytelling to tell the story of regional trends, frequency trends and recent trends. Then, highlight selected words in sample paragraphs. Last, list comparisons of key statistics between different years in terms of specific issues, eg women, children, climate, etc. Allowing users to input words by themselves and read the samples in the given two years. Data is the text of SDG annual reports from 2016 to 2022.

### Plan B: Mapping the climate change

Scientists believe the world is missing the climate target - at the U.N. climate summit in Paris in 2015, officials agreed to limit global warming to 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F), or better yet, 1.5 degrees. I plan to work on visualizing possible extreme weather events when the global average temperature rises to 1.5 degrees, 2 degrees, and 3 degrees, and the people who are affected potentially and where they are. A partial makeover of this work:

#### The reason why this should be interactive:

- For comparing multiples and they share a same base map
- Giving customized experience
